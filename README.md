### Features 
🔍 Multi-timeframe Analysis: Simultaneous analysis using ML across 1D, 1W and 1M timeframes

📊 Real-time Market Data: Live cryptocurrency prices from Binance WebSocket feeds

📈 Interactive Charts: Candlestick charts with timeframe selection

⚡ Real-time Updates: WebSocket-based live data streaming and analysis

###  ML Pipeline:
Raw Price Data >  15 Technical Indicators > Feature Vector [SMA5, EMA12, RSI14, MACD, ...] > Weka ML Model Training (3 algorithms) > Real-time Price Predictions with Confidence Scores

### ML uses these features to predict price:
- **Trend Analysis**: SMA(5,20,50,200), EMA(12,26)
- **Momentum**: RSI(14), MACD, Price Acceleration  
- **Volatility**: Standard Deviation, Z-Score, Bollinger Bands
- **Volume**: Volume-Price Trend, Volume Strength
- **Market Structure**: Support/Resistance, Market Cycles

### Models Trained:
- **Automated Model Selection**: System trains Linear Regression, SVM, and Random Forest
- **Best Model Per Timeframe**: Selects highest-performing model (based on R² score) for each timeframe
- **Single Model Prediction**: Uses only the best model for actual price predictions

**Known Limitations:**
- ML models trained on limited historical data (from 2019)
- No backtesting framework implemented
- Basic feature engineering (15 indicators)
- Real-time predictions may lag during high volatility

### Prediction Timeframes:
- 1 day, 1 week, 1 month


⚠️ **This is an experimental project**: Predictions should not be used for actual trading decisions.
